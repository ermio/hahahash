  rigor:
    'The systematic approach to quantifying or estimating soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks in baseline and project scenarios using physical soil sampling, modeling tools, default factors, or a combination of approaches.

A score of 1 indicates an approach that is not rigorous, including instances when stratification is not required, sampling is not randomized, and when sampling density is set without assessment of the inherent within-site variation. A score of 3 indicates a rigorous sampling approach, including instances when stratification using relevant factors is required, sampling within strata is randomized, and sampling density for each stratum is determined by pre-sampling to describe the within-stratum variation.

  rating:
    'We summarize each protocol with a single high-level rating on a scale from 1 to 5. The rating is determined directly from the constituent metrics. Each protocol begins with one check mark. For the rigor, durability, and additionality metrics, a score of 2/3 adds 1 check mark to the overall rating, and a score of 3/3 adds 2 check marks. For safeguards, a score of either 2/3 or 3/3 adds 1 check mark. We then multiply and round the result to renormalize to lie on a scale from 1 to 5. A perfect 5-check rating requires top scores on permanence, durability, and additionality, and at least a 2/3 on safeguards.',
