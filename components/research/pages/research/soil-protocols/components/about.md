Our goal was to identify key issues that prospective buyers and the general public more broadly should be aware of when making decisions about the procurement of soil carbon removal.

We reviewed publicly available protocols that are applied to projects to generate credits from activities that affect soil organic carbon (SOC). Our review included all the accessory documentation associated with each protocol. Protocols included in our analysis apply to a range of geographies and land management practices, including cropping, tillage, grazing, managing agricultural inputs, and other agricultural practices that affect SOC stocks. The majority of protocols address both carbon removal and emission reductions and assess changes in SOC stocks while some also track CO₂, CH₄, and N₂O emissions, and a few include other ecological and community co-benefits.

We received funding from Microsoft to perform this review. Microsoft did not exercise any control over this work. CarbonPlan is solely responsible for the content of this review, which does not represent the views of Microsoft or any other other organizations.
