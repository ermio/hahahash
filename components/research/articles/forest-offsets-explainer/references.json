    "note": "Common practice numbers use tCO₂ / acre, converting the C stored in trees' biomass to CO₂. Offset credits are denominated in terms of tCO₂e because they function in a multi-gas policy environment, where non-CO₂ gases are converted to CO₂e using 100-year global warming potentials from the 2013 IPCC assessment reports. The applicable GWP for CO₂ is 1, so only the units change when converting between CO₂ and CO₂e in this policy environment."
